# Keybase Contact Form - Vue

## Project Info

This form was designed to allow encrypting messages from site visitors to site owners. The form uses PGP encryption provided by Keybase with kbpgp.js. The front end is built out in Vuejs. The server site is built using Netlify functions. The encryption is done in the user's browser, and does not post the user's plain text message unless they choose not to encrypt.
